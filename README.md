# elm-tigershark

WIP/Exploratory project for generating typescript type declarations for elm
programs. Based off of `elm-typescript-interop`.

### Roadmap

- [x] Setup typescript and elm project
- [x] Setup elm testing
- [ ] Use `elm-syntax` to parse file contents and create basic type declaration
- [ ] Parse elm types into typescript types
- [ ] Add types for flags
- [ ] Add types for all ports in file
- [ ] CLI tool
- [ ] Multi-module typing
- [ ] Support pre-0.19 elm
- [ ] Refine port types to only include ports in compiled js

### The name

This isn't a useful tool yet so it doesn't have a useful tool name. TypeScript
and Tigershark sound a bit similar. That's all I've got.
